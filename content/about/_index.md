# Hello

Hello! My name is Chisato, it's pronounced sort of like "Chi" (as in Taichi) "Sa" "Toe".  
Or most of my friends calls me just "Chi" for short. 

Thank you for stopping by. I've discovered R few years ago, and while it took a while to get started, I have feel in love with the tool, and become somewhat obsessed. [R-blogger](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) and other blog entry has really helped me learn I am amused with amount of information being shared by the others.  

With this blog, I'll try writing what I have learned, so that hopefully I could be help of others.  

I've used [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to set up the blog itself, but I'm still quite not sure exactly how this is working.  I'm trying to figure out how to add comments section in near future.
