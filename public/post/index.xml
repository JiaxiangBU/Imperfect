      <description>I have been playing with package called imager, documentation on this package was extremely helpful! I have read through “getting started” as well as few other tutorial &amp;amp; examples.
I love colours… Tools like colourlovers, Adobe Color CC, Canva Color Palette Generators are great extracting colours from photo (or in general just getting inspirations for colour palette), but I wanted to figure out the way to extract colours from image using R.</description>

      <title>Voronoi diagram with ggvoronoi package with Train Station data</title>

      <description>I’ve always been curious to make Voronoi diagram, I just think they are beautiful! When I came across data set with train stations in Japan. I instantly thought this would be great data sets to make Voronoi diagram! I’ve gotten data sets from (Ekidata)[http://www.ekidata.jp/] site. I’m amazed how many train stations we have in Japan, as well as coverage of train systems in Japan.
There are couple of packages I could’ve used to make Voronoi diagram, but I’ve utilized package ggvoronoi.</description>

      <title>Phyllotaxis Sprial and Prime Numbers - Experiment</title>

      <description>I recently tried out Data Camp’s project called “Phyllotaxis: Draw flowers using mathematics”. Now I’m hooked on drawing spirals using golden angle. Also the mathematical art on instructor’s blog, Fronkostin is just amazing!
Separately on twitter, I’ve gotten message on art with prime number, and that got me thinking to experiment with prime number &amp;amp; phyllotaxis flowers. I couldn’t figure out how I’d generate prime numbers in R, but I came across site where you can download prime numbers.</description>

      <description>Halloween is coming..! Halloween is just around the corner, I am still trying to decide which candies to purchase this year for trick-or-treaters.
Initially I was looking for data sets maybe comparing American chocolate bars vs Canadian chocolate bars possibly with sugar contents or lists of ingredients. I am really curious why there are big differences in candy between Canada and US, but for now I couldn’t find them instead I came across below data sets.</description>

      <description>Starting today, recreational weed is legal in Canada. This news has some how lead me to find Cannabis Curve, a mathematical equation to draw Cannabis….!!!
So to celebrate? being 2nd country in the world (1st was Uruguay) to legalize the green stuff for fun, I decided I’ll try drawing cannabis curve with ggplot. Here’s the final results.
Cannabis_Final
 Here’s the step I took, because I couldn’t really understand the mathematical equation, so I’ve break it down step by step to sort of understand what each part of equation is doing.</description>

      <title>Random Walk of Pi - Another ggplot2 Experiment</title>

      <description>There are so many beautiful “π” arts everywhere, and I wanted to practice ggplot2 by mimicing those arts further more. Another pi art caught my eye is random walk of pi digits. Here’s one of examples in WIRED magazine.
For random walk to work, I’ve assigned direction to “walk” depending on digits 0-9.
I’ve prepared data frame as below, so I can use ggplot2 to plot
## pi_df contains first 100K digits , each digit is stored in one row.</description>

      <description>I stumbled across this beautiful art on Washington Post article, and I wanted to try making the similar art using “digits in pi” myself using R and things I’ve learned recently.
Get First 100000 digits of Pi After bit of googling, I stumbled across this this site, so I decided to get first 100000 digits from below website.
However, later I discovered another site where you can download the txt file, so I could’ve used this site instead, and might have been bit simpler.</description>

      <title>Environmental Performance Index - Simple Scatter Plot</title>

      <description>While reading the news that Ireland becomes world’s first country to divest from fossil fuels, I just got curious how do we measure “green-ness” of country when we rank them in general, and I came across the Environmental Performance Index page with ranking table.
Table contained 180 countries with some numerics values for Environment Performance Index, “Enviornmental Health”, “Ecosystem Vitality”.
I thought it would be interesting to plot them using ggplot2.</description>

      <title>Making Calendar with ggplot &#43; Moon Phase Calendar for fun</title>

      <description>Making Calendar with ggplot2 I recently discovered font called Moon Phase. I also recently discovered R package, suncalc, and I can get Moon Illumination data by day, so I thought I’d use both to create a simple calendar using ggplot2.
Prepping The Data To make calendar, I need to strip out weekday, month, day, week number within a month. So I can use weekday as x-axis, week number within a month as y-axis, and facet by month.</description>

      <description>16 Personalities While back, my husband introduced me to this fun online personalities test called 16 personalities. I’ve taken the test, and my personalities type came back as Mediator (Code: INFP - Role: Diplomat)
There were difinitely some traits that sounded like me, and a lot of statement I can relate for sure. It’s definitely some fun test to do.
There was a one part that stated “INFP - compromising just 4% of the population”.</description>

      <title>Daylight in Vancouver (Canada) vs Tokyo (Japan)</title>

      <description>I currently live in British Columbia, Canada. So I live above 49th parallel line. One of things that’s pretty awesome living up north is the fact you get so much longer daylights in summer time! Currently it’s May, and I’m just in love with longer daylight we are getting day by day (well till June 21st)!
Recently I came across R package called suncalc, so I had to try out using the package to pull the timetable for sunrise &amp;amp; sunset for different locations and visualize the result using ggplot2.</description>
